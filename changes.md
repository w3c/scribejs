# Change log

## Version 2.0.0

* The package has been fully converted to TypeScript. The generated javascript code _replaces_ the old code at the same place, i.e., deployed scripts should not be affected.
  * The TypeScript conversion also resulted in a major review of the code, including the usage of TypeScript-adapted lint. Too many minor changes to record them all here
  * Some older libraries have been removed because unnecessary (e.g., `safe-regex` and `moment`) or its use greatly reduces (the `underscore` package is now restricted to the client-side script, should be removed at later).
  * Better adaptation to modern js environments, primarily the usage of `async` and `await`: some older modules in the code still painstakingly generated Promises "by hand", which is unnecessary by now.
* A proper documentation has been added, generated by `typedoc`.
* Minor feature changes have also been incorporated (tolerance of scribe errors when typing extra spaces after the nickname, better display of generated link lines). By and large the functionality remained unchanged, however.

(This list is incomplete, was introduced starting at version 2.0.0 only… My sloppiness, I guess.)
