14:02:08 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:02:11 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: mgarrish has done a lot of work in PRs
14:02:25 <George> present+
14:02:47 <MattChan> ... we had a lot of discussion on WCAG zero-tolerance. We've decided on an option to address this in an editor's meeting last week
14:03:26 <MattChan> mgarrish: this is to address almost-conformance. We're not trying to create something new. Rather have publishers be able to provide a disclaimer that says they did their best, but there could still be minor imperfections
14:03:54 <MattChan> ... this PR adds disclaimer property. Nothing similar already exists in Schema.org
14:04:28 <MattChan> ... this will not be a requirement for publisher to use this. Only an option
14:04:49 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: backwards compat was important to us in picking this solution. And minimizing disruption to existing workflows
14:04:53 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:04:58 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y

14:05:43 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:06:03 <CharlesL> q+
14:06:09 <MattChan> will: is this disclaimer different from the a11y statement that a publisher would put on their website?
14:06:20 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: this would be in the epub metadata
14:06:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:07:00 <MattChan> mgarrish: the reality is that things slip through when a11y conformance is a combination of machine and human checking
14:07:07 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:07:13 <JF> Q+
14:07:19 <MattChan> ... so publisher is saying that to the best of their ability the epub meets the standard they are claiming
14:07:41 <avneeshsingh> ack charl
14:07:41 <MattChan> Will: so will it be a failure of conformance if they leave out disclaimer?
14:08:31 <MattChan> CharlesL: so you have a conformance statement. But what we're doing in addition to a11y summary statement is to have a more formal disclaimer property that publisher can add
14:08:52 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:08:58 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:09:36 <MattChan> ... for Benetech certification conformance is the same, but this will be one more thing that certified publishers can put in their epubs (to mitigate liability, etc.)
14:09:41 <avneeshsingh> ack jf
14:09:57 <CharlesL> q+
14:10:10 <MattChan> JF: so the statement says that the epub is WCAG compliant, but then the disclaimer says "not really"?
14:10:31 <MattChan> george: when I contacted Bruce Bailey from 508 access board I asked about this
14:10:40 <MattChan> ... and in 508 the standard is black and white as well
14:10:48 <MattChan> ... he said if you look hard enough, you will be able to find some defect
14:10:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:11:00 <MattChan> ... but the industry has come to peace with this issue and don't have any problems with that
14:11:14 <JF> Q+
14:11:16 <MattChan> ... our disclaimer says exactly that, and no more
14:11:21 <avneeshsingh> ack charles
14:11:36 <MattChan> CharlesL: and we also have to be backwards compat with existing epubs, which this solution is
14:11:38 <avneeshsingh> ack jf
14:11:39 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:12:02 <mgarrish> q+
14:12:34 <MattChan> JF: but the statement and the disclaimer are contradictory right? So at what point are there too many non-compliances?
14:12:35 <avneeshsingh> ack mg
14:12:52 <tzviya> q+
14:12:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:13:07 <MattChan> mgarrish: not sure that there is a contradiction. But disclaimer acknowledges that we live in an imperfect world.
14:13:29 <MattChan> ... and it creates an avenue for reporting when defects are found
14:13:46 <MattChan> s/defects/incidents of non-compliance
14:14:27 <MattChan> JF: I understand, but, I still think that the disclaimer is contradictory. WCAG is explicit in that it requires 100% perfection.
14:14:36 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:14:45 <MattChan> ... WCAG3 will acknowledge this issue of 100% compliance or nothing
14:14:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:14:59 <CharlesL> q+
14:15:06 <mgarrish> q+
14:15:15 <MattChan> ... but right now, I'm concerned that in the real world a lot of organizations won't put in the work to do a11y compliance anymore
14:15:15 <avneeshsingh> ack tz
14:15:39 <JF> +1 Tzviya
14:15:45 <MattChan> tzviya: my concern is that a disclaimer like this doesn't accomplish anything. If the point is to make sure that publishers are covered legally, I'm not sure this does it
14:15:54 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:16:23 <MattChan> ... i'd have to check with out legal team to see if something like this is useful
14:16:36 <avneeshsingh> ack charl
14:16:36 <MattChan> ... and if not, then I don't see what the purpose of this is
14:16:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:17:54 <avneeshsingh> ack mg
14:18:08 <MattChan> CharlesL: the disclaimer adds credibility for publishers that choose to go out and get 3rd party certification
14:18:09 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:18:12 <JF> Q+
14:18:34 <MattChan> mgarrish: if you don't disclaim it, you still have a false claim
14:18:49 <MattChan> ... if we don't have anything, are we any better off?
14:18:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:19:03 <tzviya> q+ to ask if intent is to say WCAG AA except x
14:19:05 <George> q+
14:19:06 <avneeshsingh> ack jf
14:19:24 <wendyreid> q+
14:19:37 <MattChan> JF: part of the answer is how we apply the metadata. One way is to ref to a URL. And the other is using a meta-element that is a text field.
14:19:53 <MattChan> ... 2nd way i think is a path towards a more accurate statement
14:19:55 <g_pellegrino> q+
14:19:59 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:20:22 <MattChan> ... from a legal perspective VPATs have a ability to say partially supports
14:20:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:20:59 <avneeshsingh> ack tz
14:20:59 <Zakim> tzviya, you wanted to ask if intent is to say WCAG AA except x
14:21:10 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:21:20 <MattChan> tzviya: part of my concern is that the document doesn't say how to use this
14:21:41 <MattChan> ... maybe if you want to say "epub is WCAG compliant except for this particular criteria in this particular circumstance"
14:21:50 <MattChan> ... seems like there is a lot of wiggle room here
14:22:12 <avneeshsingh> ack george
14:22:39 <mgarrish> q+
14:22:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:23:09 <JF> Q+
14:23:13 <MattChan> george: if JF and tzviya think this disclaimer does nothing, maybe we should get rid of it and leave things they way they have been. There are a lot of documents out there that are reporting WCAG AA, companies that sell to universities that claim WCAG AA, and if you look close enough you'll find that many of those are incorrect statements
14:23:18 <avneeshsingh> ack wen
14:23:24 <MattChan> ... the industry has come to terms with this, and maybe its not up to us to solve it
14:23:46 <MattChan> wendyreid: second tzviya that we should be clear about what is allowed
14:24:12 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:24:42 <MattChan> ... but i think this has value particularly in the retail space. When retailers start to display a11y metadata, the disclaimer is going to be important to both retailers and users. Users should be made aware of that before it gets escalated to a customer care call.
14:24:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:25:00 <MattChan> ... retailer gets accused to having a problem when the issue is in the epub
14:25:13 <MattChan> ... this is already happening, and we don't even display a11y metadata yet
14:25:24 <MattChan> ... this gives users as much information as possible
14:25:36 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:25:38 <MattChan> ... not just a legal issue, but empowers users to know what they are purchasing
14:25:53 <avneeshsingh> ack gp
14:25:57 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: one option for doing this is to include such information in the a11y summary
14:26:11 <avneeshsingh> ack next
14:26:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:27:12 <MattChan> g_pellegrino: we have to define what it means to strive for WCAG AA if, for example, there is something in your document that don't meet WCAG A
14:27:13 <avneeshsingh> ack mg
14:27:39 <MattChan> mgarrish: i pictured this mostly being used for errors that slip though, where nobody could have caught it
14:28:05 <MattChan> ... once we get to partial conformance you're not complying to epub a11y spec either
14:28:28 <MattChan> ... so the other option is that we accept that epub just shouldn't have a DC:conforms statement
14:28:47 <MattChan> ... include details in VPAT
14:28:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:29:05 <avneeshsingh> ack jf
14:29:11 <JF> <meta ... content="my VPAT.html">
14:29:13 <MattChan> ... for content that has known and potentially serious issues with it, then let's not try to solve that from a conformance perspective
14:29:27 <MattChan> JF: maybe part of the problem is that we don't want to be pointing to a specific WCAG
14:29:49 <MattChan> ... if we use a meta-declaration, could we open the spec to point to, for example, a VPAT statement?
14:30:08 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:30:19 <MattChan> ... re. george's statement of institutions that already claim conformance, some EDUs want very richly annotated VPATs
14:30:23 <mgarrish> q+
14:30:44 <MattChan> ... so in some ways a short, patterned conformance statement is less useful than a detailed document
14:30:52 <avneeshsingh> ack mg
14:30:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:31:02 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: there are some mechanisms already built into metadata to deal with this
14:31:26 <MattChan> mgarrish: doesn't seem right to say that VPAT is a conformance statement. A VPAT is a report of how you conform to something else
14:31:38 <MattChan> ... there's nothing something can determine from that sort of URL
14:32:31 <MattChan> ... you can put it in if you want. The spec can't prevent you from doing that. But not sure we want to put that in the spec.
14:32:39 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:32:44 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: certifierReport is the right place for that sort of thing
14:32:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:33:08 <MattChan> ... to summarize, we don't like the disclaimer. It may be useful, but not for the purpose for which it was created.
14:33:12 <MattChan> ... let's leave it for now
14:33:30 <MattChan> ... mgarrish are you satisfied with the certifierReport and other metadata that can meet this need?
14:33:52 <MattChan> mgarrish: maybe we can make it clear that even if you aren't providing a conformance claim you can still provide a link to a certifierReport
14:34:06 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: i think it would be nice to explain that these can be used in this way
14:34:08 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:34:23 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:34:31 <JF> Q+
14:34:54 <MattChan> george: if we have no conformance statement you could still include certifiedby and you could clarify in your a11y summary what you conform to
14:35:10 <MattChan> ... when the metadata is shown according to the UX guide, for conformsto it would say none provided, right?
14:35:23 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: yes, for now, but we still have to revisit the UX guide
14:35:28 <avneeshsingh> ack jf
14:35:35 <MattChan> JF: the only other potential problem i see is WCAG3
14:35:52 <MattChan> ... from the start WCAG3 is being built for various levels of conformance: bronze, silver, gold
14:36:05 <MattChan> ... and a scoring mechanism still being sorted out
14:36:39 <MattChan> ... so we're going to have to be able to declare which which level an epub is at
14:36:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:37:14 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:37:27 <CharlesL> q+
14:37:27 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: no, we've decided that we're not going with this disclaimer route, so we don't need to state closeness of conformance
14:37:47 <MattChan> ... and if you don't completely conform, then the epub shouldn't include a conformance statement
14:37:47 <avneeshsingh> ack charl
14:38:39 <JF> Q+ human error OR difference of opinion/interpretation
14:38:39 <MattChan> CharlesL: I'm not in favor of pulling the disclaimer. The disclaimer puts publishers at ease, acknowledges forgiveness for human error, provides route for reporting. I think having it is better than not.
14:38:56 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:38:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:39:01 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: let's continue discussion in issue tracker, as I don't think we can resolve on this issue today
14:39:12 <mgarrish> q+
14:39:26 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:39:27 <MattChan> CharlesL: I think we should vote on this today
14:40:13 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: per W3C practice we need consensus
14:40:33 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:40:39 <MattChan> ... at 2 months away from CR, and with some publishers missing, I'm not sure a vote is a good idea right now
14:40:50 <avneeshsingh> ack next
14:40:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:41:11 <CharlesL> +1 to Matts suggestion.
14:41:33 <MattChan> mgarrish: we don't need to make this either/or. Disclaimer is optional. But we can still add explanatory statement that people can leave out conformsto and link to VPAT.
14:41:44 <MattChan> JF: I like that route. Choice is good.
14:41:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:42:07 <MattChan> mgarrish: from an editing perspective I can let you look at both and see how you feel
14:42:21 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:42:27 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:42:32 <JF> Q+
14:42:40 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: so, for people who were opposed to this, does the non-compulsory nature of the disclaimer change your mind?
14:42:55 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:42:56 <MattChan> tzviya: I think it needs to be clearer how the disclaimer is intended to be used
14:43:04 <MattChan> mgarrish: sure, I can try to work on that
14:43:18 <avneeshsingh> ack jf
14:43:26 <MattChan> george: in my mind bottom line is that there is no catastrophic failure
14:43:29 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:43:52 <MattChan> JF: even though disclaimer is optional, I think we're going to see it all the time. We're back to the contradictory statements.
14:44:44 <g_pellegrino> q+
14:44:52 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:45:03 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: so it would serve the purpose of allowing the publisher to make a more accurate statement, rather than providing any legal certainty
14:45:20 <MattChan> mgarrish: and we can clarify that putting in a disclaimer doesn't absolve you from legal liability
14:45:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:46:39 <MattChan> mgarrish: do we want to rename it to contact information rather than disclaimer?
14:47:00 <MattChan> ... I think ONIX does a similar thing
14:47:10 <MattChan> JF: and that contact info is baked into VPATs as well
14:47:27 <avneeshsingh> ack next
14:47:39 <MattChan> g_pellegrino: if its only simple text we could put it in the last sentence of the a11y summary
14:47:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:48:23 <MattChan> CharlesL: the whole reason for this was because publishers were worried about saying conformsto WCAG AA. I don't think adding a contact us address that issue.
14:48:32 <JF> +1 to Charles, we need both
14:48:40 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:48:46 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: it seems we don't have consensus. So let's continue discussion in issue tracker.
14:49:12 <MattChan> ... and let's remember that we are just 2 months away from CR, so we can't many too many changes this time around

14:51:27 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: okay, so let's do that
14:51:50 <MattChan> ... this one is about potentially having a certification date
14:51:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:52:13 <MattChan> mgarrish: if you want to put a date in your can use a dc:terms value, and to attach that to the certifier
14:52:27 <avneeshsingh> q?
14:52:31 <MattChan> ... its not something we're defining, or that we require, but the question keeps coming up
14:52:34 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y

14:53:36 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: TPAC meetings. There are 4 topics suggested.
14:53:38 <avneeshsingh> * Horizontal review of the Epub suite
14:53:45 <avneeshsingh> * Related work in APA, Epub, CSS (and possibly other WG)
14:53:56 <avneeshsingh> * on spoken presentation.
14:53:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
14:54:01 <avneeshsingh> * Normative use of schema in W3C specifications in the light of introduction of registries in Process 2021.
14:54:48 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: all of these are not specific to epub. 1 is. But 2-3 are publishing in general.
14:54:51 <CharlesL> q+

15:00:44 <JF> Q+
15:00:45 <MattChan> tzviya: looking at the proposed agenda, re. #4, what is that?
15:01:16 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: its a brainstorming session affecting specs in general
15:01:59 <George> George has joined #epub-a11y
15:02:33 <MattChan> TF: at a higher level there is a discussion within W3C for having a normative place to put fragments. e.g. In WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.3.5 has a taxonomy of terms that is in the spec. This would look at a place for storing such things to be referenced by normative specs
15:02:46 <MattChan> ... a11y is one area this would affect, but other W3C groups would have a use for this as well
15:03:03 <MattChan> avneeshsingh: let's adjourn the call for now
