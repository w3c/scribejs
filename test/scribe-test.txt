17:07:01 <ivan> …30 percent of world's journal articles

17:08:47 <ivan> Topic: Publishing Business Group update
17:08:48 <ivan> Present+ BillMcCoy, Garth
17:08:51 <Karen> …I believe Bill McCoy is on the call to give us an update on the PBG
17:09:03 <Karen> BillMcCoy: The Publishing Business Group is formed
17:09:14 <dauwhe> https://www.w3.org/community/publishingbg/
17:09:19 <Karen> …if you are not sure if your org is eligible, just clicked the join link and we'll address it manually
17:09:34 <Karen> …First Publishing BG meeting is 10:30am-2:30pm London time
17:09:44 <Karen> …there is a list, but people are still arriving
17:09:53 <Karen> …we have a special TPI program for eligible IDPF members
17:10:07 <Karen> …we should start having email exchanges on the Publishing BG shortly
17:10:19 <Karen> …the steering committee is active, which is the former IDPF board members
17:10:31 <Karen> …ultimately the PBG will elect the steering committee
17:10:34 <Karen> …Agenda is there
17:10:43 <Karen> …Expect discussions about charter will take place on GitHub
17:10:55 <Karen> …there will be people in Publishing BG who are not part of this group, mainly for historical reasons
17:11:00 <Garth> q?
17:11:12 <Karen> …to be as inclusive as possible, would be good if the charter discussions happened in GitHub
17:11:18 <Karen> …Do you want more details?
17:11:26 <Karen> Garth: any input as to how the Business Group
17:11:38 <Karen> …which is expected to provide input to the charter of the WG
17:11:44 <Karen> …how that process will go, and timing thereof?
17:12:00 <ivan> BillMcCoy: Chartering of a WG at W3C has many steps, unlike the CG and BGs
17:12:11 <ivan> …a WG has a number of more steps, including consent of all the W3C members
17:12:33 <ivan> …we want to get that done as soon as possible, but we want to be inclusive to the whole publishing community
17:12:36 <ivan> …a balancing act
17:12:44 <ivan> …this group is ready to move on with the strawman draft charter
17:12:51 <ivan> …there seems to be significant consensus
17:13:05 <ivan> …but key factor is to get broader feedback from the community that has not been here for the past two years
17:13:12 <ivan> …have the charter be attractive to the broader industry
17:13:17 <ivan> …I don't think it will be that long
17:13:22 <ivan> …this group has done an excellent job
17:13:33 <ivan> …I hope the BG can get to a 'looks good to us'
17:13:33 <ivan> scribe-
