**Tzviya Siegman:** any comments or feedback?  
… minutes approved  

> ***Resolution #1: last week's minutes approved***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

### 2. Web Pub doc reorganization
{: #section2}

**Matt Garrish:** I've done a couple of PR merges  
… we said the ambition was to pull apart the manifest from  Web Pub  
… so audiobooks may not conflict with Web Pub  
… we split it in 3 parts  
… Part I is the abstract manifest, shared with all digital publications  
… the section largely looks the same as it did (manifest, IDL, etc), just generalized  
… in 2.6 properties have been generalized as well, categories are now defined for each property  
… it will help with extensibility, but also helps describing the property type  
… the most recent update was to move the manifest lifecycle into this section as well  
… once you have the manifest, the process tends to be the same across the different formats  
… Ivan generalized the steps between the different manifests  
… Part II is about Web Publication  
… all the sections say how it extends from the general manifest section, so no need to repeat  
… the rest of it is unchanged  
… Part III is where we intend to define how to extend the manifest, and compatibility requirements  
… that's the quick summary of the latest changes, questions welcome  

**Ivan Herman:** one more thing to emphasize: in Part III we define what is needed when you define a new profile (audio profile will be a test case)  
… a profile can define extra steps in canonicalization, extra checks, etc. the extension points are well defined  

**Tzviya Siegman:** other questions, comments?  

**George Kerscher:** must there be a profile for all formats?  
… if you want to do a single file journal article, would that be a profile?  

**Ivan Herman:** in theory, no.  
… the question will be if for some categories there are requirements that make it necessary to have a specific profile  
… e.g. if having an author is a MUST, then you need a profile (as the generic rule is a SHOULD)  
… or an audiobook could say all entries in reading order must be audio files  

**Tzviya Siegman:** for things like a basic journal article, which is not different from HTML, I don't expect people to start using it  

**George Kerscher:** the base Web Pub would support trade books, and text books?  

**Ivan Herman:** as far as I can see, yes  

**Bill Kasdorf:** would it be reasonable to say that a Web page of a journal article is inherently a Web pub?  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I don't think so, there are requirements that many web sites don't meet  

> *Luc Audrain:* +1

**Bill Kasdorf:** ok, so it's one direction not the other  

> *George Kerscher:* +1

**Tzviya Siegman:** I think we can vote, are we ready to publish that as the next editor draft?

**Tzviya Siegman:** thx Matt and Ivan for the work!  

### 3. ToC algorithm
{: #section3}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/378](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/378)

**Tzviya Siegman:** issue 378  
… the issue is "what goes into ToC?"  
… the proposal is to leave things as is, unless we have evidence it needs to be adjusted  
… mateus said they need extra types (chemistry, music) in the ToC  

**Mateus Teixeira:** I can provide examples from NN  

**Matt Garrish:** there are two issues, one is allowing markup within the ToC labels (#414), but #378 is more about the various _structures_ of ToC  
… what kind of different structuring of the ToC should we try to account for  
… maybe we should wait and see  

**Ivan Herman:** my impression is that the possibility of putting advanced markup in label is different from #378  
… the reason I raised it back then is that some structural things (e.g. section elements) are ignored by the algo, and I was wondering if other things should be ignored too  
… my feeling is that the answer is no; but it doesn't mean we can't allow MathML  
… it seems we can close #378 without much problems, regardless of what we decide for the markup of labels  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I agree with that  

> *Mateus Teixeira:* +1, but I'll share examples either way

**Tzviya Siegman:** mateus can provide examples for #414 then  

**Matt Garrish:** right, we're waiting for evidence for more table of contents  
… we can close it and raise specific issues, specific kind of ToC when we have evidence or examples  

**Tzviya Siegman:** the proposal is to leave the algo as is and close #378  

**Ivan Herman:** yes, I have the impression that the structure of the ToC, as currently described, should be fine as-is.  

**Mateus Teixeira:** true  

> *Avneesh Singh:* +1

**Tzviya Siegman:** ok, so overwhelming support for closing #378, and mateus will add comment to #414  

> *Romain Deltour:* +1

> *Charles LaPierre:* +1

> *Wendy Reid:* +1

> *Luc Audrain:* +1

> *Mateus Teixeira:* +1

### 4. draft proposal for audiobooks
{: #section4}

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://raw.githack.com/wareid/audiobooks/draft/index.html](https://raw.githack.com/wareid/audiobooks/draft/index.html)

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://w3c.github.io/audiobooks/](https://w3c.github.io/audiobooks/) also works

**Wendy Reid:** special thanks to Laurent for the link  
… I proposed a first PR, Ivan and Laurent left a ton of feedback  
… we're planning on merging it shortly, as it's not easy to comment right now  
… the approach is one of balancing between WebPub and Audiobooks  
… I wanted to make it readable for someone who didn't read WebPub  
… happy to fix it wherever needed  

**Ivan Herman:** can we pick one or two of the issues I listed, which require brainstorming?  

**Wendy Reid:** yes!  

#### 4.1. Does Reading order only includes audio files?
{: #section4-1}

**Ivan Herman:** one question I had is: if I take an audio book, and want to differentiate it from other Web Pub, is it reasonable to say that the reading order contains audio files only?  
… (and anything else can be in the list of resources)  
… is it reasonable to say? would it make it easier to produce? or is it unnecessary?  

**Wendy Reid:** I think we discussed it, about supplemental content  
… we came to the conclusion that for the initial version, we would make the reading order audio only, and non-audio resources would be in the resource list  

> *Avneesh Singh:* I remember the same. Audio profile will have list of audio in reading order.

> *Garth Conboy:* +1 to Wendy

**Marisa DeMeglio:** I don't disagree, but looking at the examples, I wouldn't know where to render cover and content (rel values)  

**Wendy Reid:** I think Laurent opened issue #405 about this  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** historically it seems UA don't want to do anything, they want to be told what to do  

**Tzviya Siegman:** before we continue, I think we'll want to keep the audiobook issues in the main repo  

**Wendy Reid:** right, _do not log issues to the audiobook repo, use the main Web Pub repo_  

**George Kerscher:** when we discussed this there were two proposed solutions, one is the rel value, one is the supplemental ToC  

**Wendy Reid:** I did include it in the draft that if you have supplemental content, you must have a ToC  

**Ivan Herman:** then this should be in the document? Formally this is one area where audiobooks impose a restriction that WebPub doesn't have, so it should be documented  
… in the general structure there is a possibility that I do not provide a reading order at all, in which case it falls back to the default where the entry page is the only content in reading order  
… which is HTML and not audio, so we have to say that a reading order MUST be provided  

**Bill Kasdorf:** there can be audiobooks of podcasts, with a transcript for accessibility?  

**Wendy Reid:** yes  

#### 4.2. Usage of `duration`; is it required?
{: #section4-2}

**Ivan Herman:** so, duration is a new property, there was several questions there  
… are there 2 places where 'duration' can be used? For the entire publication and individual audio resources?  

**Wendy Reid:** yes  

**Ivan Herman:** is the duration, for the whole publication, a required property?  

**Wendy Reid:** I think it should be required as UA would find it very useful, but on the other hand it could be calculated  
… it's nice to know  

**Tzviya Siegman:** based on discussions we had (calculation can be incorrect), I think I would make it a required property  

**Avneesh Singh:** yes, it is a burden to expect RS to calculate it; it is also an important piece of metadata  
… so it should be mandatory for the publication, and can be optional for individual files  
… another question was about media fragments, can you point to a precise position into an audio resource?  

**Wendy Reid:** yes, you're right we should specify that  

**Luc Audrain:** for the duration, it's true that publishers will expose the total duration to the users  
… it's displayed on vendor's web sites; but we don't want to rely on metadata that is _inside_ the package  
… but I agree with Avneesh that it should be mandatory  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* that sounds like an ONIX issue

**Garth Conboy:** thinking back of EPUB where we have metadata about properties about individual resources: it can be useful, but the RS will have to process the resources and figure out what the real length is anyway, there's no guarantee the metadata is right  

**Tzviya Siegman:** historically we had a problem with EPUB about the ability to rely on the provided information, but that should not be a reason why it can't be in the specification  
… not all distributors are using ONIX  
… since the property exists in schema.org we can reuse it  

> *Joshua Pyle:* +1 to Tzviya

**Garth Conboy:** the question is whether it should be required, you can have arguments both ways  

> *George Kerscher:* a+

**Wendy Reid:** right. I think it should be required; of course it puts the onus on content creators  

**Laurent Le Meur:** the metadata must be taken as a descriptive metadata  
… we should not make it required; like all descriptive metadata it can be optional  
… if there's a discrepancy with ONIX metadata and in-package metadata, it's not an issue if it's descriptive only  

**George Kerscher:** the ONIX record needs to find out from somewhere what the information is  
… it seems like having metadata about the book in the book enables correct cataloging in all kinds of different places  
… I would think the metadata would be the authoritative  

**Avneesh Singh:** I agree with George; we're producing audio books since 1996  
… if there are inaccuracies it's because there are no proper standards, but if this becomes mandated, production tools will generate this metadata correctly  

**Ivan Herman:** I think editorially we have an open issue (no consensus)  
… you (wendy) as an editor makes one choice, and link to the issue  

**Joshua Pyle:** as a system implementor, I love required things  
… if something is optional, then my implementation will have to do it, to calculate it  
… and if I do it, I'm always gonna use it  

> *Luc Audrain:* +1 to Josh

**Joshua Pyle:** so as an implementor an optional info is useless  
… that is critical info, so why would you not want it there?  

**Luc Audrain:** I agree with Josh's earlier comment; the content creator knows the duration of the book  
… it's not an issue to make it mandatory in the manifest, it's a better situation of UA developers  

**George Kerscher:** the audio book (complete publication) is in audio, with supplemental material  
… with a Web publication with video clips, there can be video clips here and there, it's not a global duration  
… the publication is not fundamentally time based  
… so we need to differentiate something completely time-based, and something with time-based content  

#### 4.3. Duration for non-audio
{: #section4-3}

**Ivan Herman:** can we move on to a different question on duration?  
… I presume that you refer to schema.org duration?  

**Wendy Reid:** yes  

**Ivan Herman:** the schema.org duration is defined on the MediaObject type  
… which also applies e..g. to video  
… so maybe duration as a property should move to the generic Web Publication spec  
… maybe the property itself can be defined in general, but generally defined on individual resources  
… but audiobooks (and "videobooks") would specify its usage for the book as a whole  
… we separate between the usage of the property on top-level and individual media entities  

> *George Kerscher:* +1 to what Ivan is saying

**Ivan Herman:** there are schema.org vocabs that we have to discuss, but we can leave it to later discussions  

**Wendy Reid:** I agree  

**Wendy Reid:** this was a productive discussion!
