[2019-05-20 12:20:59] <nickruffilo> Laurent: Lets start with #35.  The issue is about file and characters to disallow explicitly (or not) in a specification.  There were few comments and I put in the draft a sentence that's in the last comment of the thread.  I feel it is sufficient.
[2019-05-20 12:21:38] <nickruffilo> ... if there are no unhappy comments, we can close the issue.  The resolution would be to just quote the zip specifications - which has only a few constraints on the file and directory names - no use of explicit characters.

[2019-05-20 12:22:56] <laurent> resolution The [ZIP] specification has few constraints on the characters allowed for file and directory names.

With the eye of writing tests, it makes it really hard to write a test for these sort of things.  If I was building an implementation, what would I have to do.  I don't have answers but I have a general concern that we need testable assertions
[2019-05-20 12:27:00] <nickruffilo> Laurent: I agree
[2019-05-20 12:27:19] <laurent> a rule about missing resources (indicated in the manifest but missing in the zip) and another about extra resources (present in the zip but missing in the manifest). In the first case, the safe side is to consider the Package invalid -> stop its processing. In the second case, it is to consider that the extra resources are not harmful and consider the Package valid.
[2019-05-20 12:27:27] <nickruffilo> ... This sort of defintions of packaging - it's not a conformance.  There is an alternative proposal that I'm writing now.  (pasted in IRC)
[2019-05-20 12:28:12] <nickruffilo> ... we could consider an UA as a parsers - and if it see missing items, it should raise an error and consider the package damaged.

In the XML world, if a file isn't well formed, the parser must refuse...
[2019-05-20 12:30:22] <nickruffilo> ... epub has formal validation - but we're relatively silent as to how reading systems should conform to this.  I would lean towards not requiring user agents to give up if they see an error.

[2019-05-20 12:34:07] <nickruffilo> Wendy: The packaging spec isn't a profile of the main spec, it's a companion
[2019-05-20 12:34:15] <nickruffilo> Bill: I wanted to make sure we weren't creating a conflict there.
[2019-05-20 12:34:37] <nickruffilo> Wendy: in this case, the packaging spec is a companion, but it may be replaced if web packaging becomes a thing for example.

[2019-05-20 12:35:20] <nickruffilo> Laurent: I agree with Nick to think positively about the user agent where it has to do something if resources exist.  My only worry is that we have to address user agent conformance.
[2019-05-20 12:35:44] <nickruffilo> ... We could end up with a user agent processing model.  That it has to open the manifest and process the reading order.  Do we want to go there?
[2019-05-20 12:36:21] <nickruffilo> ... especially since we already have a processing model in the WP spec.
[2019-05-20 12:36:50] <nickruffilo> Wendy: Should the packaging model not differ to the WP spec?  Wouldn't need to be in the packaging spec...
[2019-05-20 12:37:17] <nickruffilo> Laurent: What is the processing model in the main spec.  I'm not sure we have spec'd anything about that yet.
[2019-05-20 12:37:29] <nickruffilo> Wendy: It would fall into the web publications.
[2019-05-20 12:38:25] — nickruffilo nellie - your keyboard is making quite a bit of noise, please mute :)
[2019-05-20 12:39:06] <nickruffilo> Wendy: I think the packaging spec should just reference the processing model of web publications and use that.  It seems the clearest way to proceed
[2019-05-20 12:39:09] — nickruffilo thank you
[2019-05-20 12:39:23] <nickruffilo> Laurent: I can try - it'll be two lines.
[2019-05-20 12:39:35] <nickruffilo> Wendy: There are lots of items in the audiobook spec that feel the same

[2019-05-20 12:40:19] <nickruffilo> Laurent: Moving on to another one we should solve today and close #32 about mimetype.  Shoudl we have a mimetype file in the package.  It seems that the consensus was to have no mimetype in the package.  If there was a mimetype it should be first in the package...
[2019-05-20 12:41:06] <nickruffilo> ... it would be good for processors who didn't want to open the zip to know what it is.  When it comes to helping studios - the consensus seemed to be avoid having any sort of mimetype file.
[2019-05-20 12:41:16] <nickruffilo> ... Maybe it'll write a proposal for resolution and we'll discuss it
[2019-05-20 12:41:26] <laurent> proposal is : there will be no mimetype file in the package file.

[2019-05-20 12:42:37] <nickruffilo> Laurent: in the file extension or if it is downloaded, it can rely on a mimetype exposed from the web.  If you have it in a filesystem it is about the file extension

[2019-05-20 12:45:48] <nickruffilo> ... in the draft the extension is .lpf (lightweight package format) mimetype is application/lfp+zip
